      SplitFit was founded by three childhood
      friends who saw an opportunity to revolutionize personal training. Having been
      in the fitness industry for years they realized that between noon and 5pm gyms
      typically have unbooked trainers on staff who are being paid to wait until
      their next session. By building an easy way for people to find and book these
      trainers people would be able to access training at a lower price point while
      still generating additional revenue for the gym.

  <h2>
    Creating SplitFit
  </h2>

  <p>
    SplitFit came to thoughtbot with only an idea. We started day one with a
    design sprint to validate their idea. By the end of week one we conducted our
    first round of user testing and interviews.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Problem Statement
  </h2>

  <p>
    Personal training is too expensive, isnâ€™t accessible to non-members and
    gyms have an excess of unused inventory.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Prototype &amp; User Testing
  </h2>

  <p>
    We created a prototype that was built in Xcode. This let users run the
    prototype on their iPhone. They were able to set preferences, build profiles
    and use the keyboard as they would normally with any other app. We caught
    issues much earlier and more accurately than we would have with a traditional
    prototyping approach (creating a prototype with hotspots and images).
  </p>

  <p>
    The outcome of the first week was incredibly successful. The prototype and business idea was well received. We confidently moved forward knowing that we conducted an initial round of user testing. We started to build out and refine wireframes for each of the designed user flows.
